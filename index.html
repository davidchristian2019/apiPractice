<!-- This app doesn't follow a11y best practices, and the JS file is incomplete. Complete the getBreweries, displayResults, and watchSubmit functions. When you're done, this app should allow a user to search for a state, and display a list of breweries in that state. The list should include the brewery's name and a link to their website. You should make requests to this API: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ . Make any necessary adjustments to make this app accessible. -->
